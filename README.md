# Classification Case Study: Predicting Customer Churn

## Project Overview
This is a Python-based classification case study to predict whether a customer will churn. The project covers the full workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.

## Objective
- Predict customer churn using historical data
- Apply machine learning models to identify patterns and make predictions
- Evaluate model performance and provide actionable insights

## Dataset
- Source: [Add dataset source or link here]
- Features include customer demographics, usage patterns, and account information.

## Methods
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Building:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
4. Model Evaluation:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## Results
- Best model: Random Forest
- Accuracy: 87%
- Insights: The model shows that monthly usage and customer tenure are the strongest indicators of churn risk.
